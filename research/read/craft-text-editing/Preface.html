<h1>Preface</h1>

<p>Just over eleven years ago I was faced with selecting a topic for
my thesis.  At the time, I was a student at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology and was working on my bachelor's degree in
Computer Science and Engineering.  One of the degree requirements was
a thesis, and you can't have a thesis without a topic.</p>

<p>During my four years at M.I.T., a new type of text editor had come
into being and widespread use.  This type of text editor was called
"Emacs," and it was a major step forward in many ways.
Implementations of this type of editor were appearing on many computer
systems.  Some people even used an implementation as the basis for
their thesis.  I took a different tack.  The idea that I settled on
for my thesis was a description of the technology that underlies all
text editors, but with a special emphasis on Emacs-type editors.  The
thesis was written and published as a technical memo (Finseth
1980).</p>

<p>Ten years later, I was reading the USENET News news group
Comp.editors, one of the many facets of that worldwide electronic
bulletin board.  A discussion thread had started up in which
<i>both</i> sides of the discussion were citing my thesis as the
authority in the field.  Further inquiries (not by me: I was just
reading along) showed that no one in that group was aware of any other
document that described general text-editing technology.</p>

<p>My thesis was ten years old: it predated most personal computers
and workstations.  There had even been a chapter in an early draft
that attempted to prove that it was not possible to implement an
Emacs-type text editor on a small computer.  (I invented a way, threw
out the chapter, and with some friends started a software company to
market such an editor.  Oh well.)  It was clearly time for a complete
rewrite, and that rewrite is what you are reading now.</p>

<p>If you don't have a copy of my thesis (or the <i>Technical Memo</i>:
the two have identical content), you won't miss anything.  This book
has all of the information from the earlier document, and is now
updated.  It also has a whole lot more.  Every part has been
completely rewritten and expanded, and major sections have been
added.</p>

<p>As with my thesis, this book is written in an informal, almost
chatty style.  It is addressed directly to "you," who are assumed to
care about how text editors are implemented.  Be warned, however, that
it also contains opinions about the "right" and "wrong" way of doing
things and that these opinions hold that many of the current
directions and trends are -- shall we say? -- not the "right" way.
You should keep in mind that you should not accept everything said in
here as the gospel truth, but understand why I say what I say and make
your own informed judgment.</p>

<p>This book is addressed to anyone who implements large software
systems or who wants to know the considerations that go into such
systems.  It focuses around text editors.  Although not required, an
understanding of programming will be helpful.</p>

<h2>Questions to Probe Your Understanding</h2>

<p>Each chapter ends with a set of questions and problems designed to
probe your understanding of the material that was just presented.
And, true to the Socratic method, some of these questions also
introduce new material.  The level of difficulty of the questions
ranges from very easy to quite difficult, and each question is
labelled to help you gauge how much effort is required.  Just as with
most programming issues, most questions have no single correct
answer.</p>
