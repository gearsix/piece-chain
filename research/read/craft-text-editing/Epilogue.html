<h1>Epilogue</h1>

<blockquote>
'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:<br>
All mimsy were the borogoves,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And the mome raths outgrabe.<br>
</blockquote>

<p>And so concludes the verse &quot;Jabberwocky&quot; by Lewis
Carroll.  A piece of nonsense verse embedded in a nonsense work, it
resembles the &quot;real world&quot; about as much as a computer
program does.  Which is perhaps why Lewis Carroll is so popular among
computer programmers.</p>

<p>And, before you ask, the chapter structure of this book was worked
out well before the fit of the verse was noticed. Right.</p>

<h2>Questions to Probe Your Understanding</h2>

<p>What parts of &quot;Jabberwocky&quot; fit particularly well with
the chapters that they lead off?  Particularly poorly?  (Easy -- or is
it?)</p>
